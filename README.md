## 🎯 Why this README works (important)

This version:
- ✅ Clearly shows **MPI + C++**
- ✅ Signals **HPC / RSE competence**
- ✅ Avoids claiming domain expertise in hydrology
- ✅ Matches **KIT / Helmholtz / RSE** expectations
- ✅ Is short enough to be read in **90 seconds**

Most RSE reviewers will stop after:
- Overview
- Technical Approach
- Technologies

And that’s enough to impress.

## ✅ What to do next (recommended)
1. Replace README  
2. Commit  
3. Make repo **public**

Then:
- Add **`MPI (C++)`** to your **Scientific Computing skills** (as we discussed)
- Do **not** add this repo as a CV project
- Be ready to share it **if asked** in interviews

If you want next, I can:
- Do a **KIT-style interview answer** using this MPI project
- Review the **code structure** (light, not deep)
- Decide **which other roles** this repo helps with

You handled this exactly right — this is a **quiet but powerful signal**.
